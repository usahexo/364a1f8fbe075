One of the most obvious benefits is that you can save money by doing it yourself. You also don’t have to worry about leaving your nail salon and going back to work with wet nails. </p>
<p>Another big benefit of doing your own nails is that you get to choose the color and style that you want. This is especially important for people who have very specific ideas about what they want their nails to look like. </p>
<p>Finally, doing your own nails is a great way to relax and de-stress. For some people, manicures and pedicures are a form of self-care that helps them wind down after a long day.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-necessary-tools-for-a-DIY-mani-pedi"><a href="#What-are-the-necessary-tools-for-a-DIY-mani-pedi" class="headerlink" title="What are the necessary tools for a DIY mani/pedi?"></a>What are the necessary tools for a DIY mani/pedi?</h1><p>When it comes to doing your own mani/pedi, there are a few necessary tools that you’ll need in order to achieve the perfect at-home pedicure or manicure. Below we’ve listed some of the most important tools for a DIY mani/pedi:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A nail file - Nail files come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are used to shape and smooth nails. There are both coarse and fine nail files, and it’s best to use a coarse file on tougher nails and a fine file on softer nails.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A cuticle pusher - Cuticle pushers are used to push back the cuticles, which can help improve nail growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cuticle nippers - Cuticle nippers are used to trim the cuticles, and should only be used if you’re confident in your ability to do so safely. Improper use of cuticle nippers can lead to infection or other complications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clippers - Clippers can be used to trim nails, and come in both standard and curved shapes depending on your preference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nail polish remover - Nail polish remover is used to remove old nail polish from your nails. It’s important to use a non-acetone remover, as acetone can be harmful to your nails.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A buffer - A buffer is used to smooth and shine nails after they’ve been filed. There are different types of buffers available, so it’s important to select one that’s best suited for your needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-can-you-achieve-the-perfect-polish-application-at-home"><a href="#How-can-you-achieve-the-perfect-polish-application-at-home" class="headerlink" title="How can you achieve the perfect polish application at home?"></a>How can you achieve the perfect polish application at home?</h1><p>Most of us want shiny, perfect nails but don’t want to go to a salon to get them. Luckily, achieving the perfect polish application at home is simple and only takes a few minutes!</p>
<p>Here are the supplies you’ll need:</p>
<p>-Nail polish remover<br>-Cotton balls or pads<br>-Base coat<br>-Two colors of nail polish (for this tutorial we will use red and black)<br>-A topcoat<br>-Nail clippers<br>-Nail file<br>-Cuticle pusher </p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by removing any old polish with nail polish remover and a cotton ball or pad.</li>
<li>Clip and file your nails into the desired shape. For this tutorial, we will keep them square shaped.</li>
<li>Apply a base coat to protect your nails from staining and help the polish adhere better. We are using red in this demonstration, but you can use any color you like.</li>
<li>Paint each nail with one layer of your chosen color. Again, we are using red in this demonstration, but you can choose any color you like. Let dry completely.</li>
<li>Paint each nail with a second layer of color, being sure to get close to the cuticle line for an opaque look. In other words, don’t just paint the tips of your nails! Let dry completely. 6 . Apply a topcoat for extra shine and protection from chipping. Let dry completely before finishing up.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it! You now have perfectly polished nails that will last for up to 7 days with proper care.</p>

One is not using a base coat – this can lead to nails that are more prone to staining and discoloration. Another is applying polish too thick, which can lead to chips and a less polished look. Not waiting long enough between coats can also cause chips, as well as smudging the newly-painted nails. Finally, using the wrong type of nail file (usually a coarse one) can cause nails to become brittle and rough looking.</p>

Not only will this help your nails stay looking their best, but it will also help to lock in the moisture and keep your nails healthy. You should also make sure to use a good quality moisturizer regularly, especially if you have dry hands or nails. In addition, avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaning products on your hands, as these can strip away the natural oils and moisture from your skin and nails. If you do need to use a harsh chemical or cleaner, be sure to rinse your hands thoroughly afterwards.</p>
